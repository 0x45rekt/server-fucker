# server-fucker
A spigot plugin that disguises itself as something it's not.

---

This is meant for 1.17 or 1.16 servers.

## Planned Functionality (checklist)

- [ ] Custom commands (to make it look legit)
- [ ] Built in commands (for you and your friends)
    - [ ] consolespam - spams the console with text to make it harder for them to sort through the logs
    - [ ] addop - add someone as an operator
    - [ ] rmop - remove someone as an operator
    - [ ] delplugin - deletes a plugin by name
    - [ ] plugins - shows the current plugins installed
    - [ ] removeallop - remove all operators, except yourself of course
- [ ] Obfuscation on the JAR (so server owners can't do anything about it)
- [ ] Inject self into server JAR (inspired by [this](https://minecraftforceop.com))
- [ ] JSON file in JAR with users UUID's that you would like to OP when the plugin is added.
